# Byways 08: Android App Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Wrap the Byways web app in a sideloadable Android app with native voice, speech, media keys, networking, share-in, an in-app site view and the Lab on its own origin.

**Architecture:** One Kotlin Activity hosts a main WebView that serves the web build from APK assets through `WebViewAssetLoader`, plus a second bridge-less WebView for sites. The web layer talks to Kotlin only through `addWebMessageListener` with a small JSON codec, and `src/platform/android.js` turns that bridge into the contract's `Platform` object. Logic that can be tested without a device (URL policy, HTTP executor, codec, error map, link policy, update compare) lives in plain Kotlin classes with JVM tests that run in GitHub Actions.

**Tech Stack:** Kotlin (AGP 9.3.2 built-in Kotlin), Gradle 9.7.1 (no wrapper), `androidx.webkit:webkit:1.18.0`, `androidx.activity:activity-ktx:1.11.0`, JUnit 4.13.2, `org.json:json:20240303` (tests only), JavaScript ES2022 modules, `node:test`, `@playwright/test@1.63.0`.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-11-byways-design.md` (§13.4, §4 Android column, §6.2, §6.4, §6.6, §14.3, §17.1, §17.3, §20). Contract: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-11-byways-00-overview.md`. Notes: `docs/superpowers/specs/byways-research/platform-shells.md`, `hands-free.md`, `other-providers.md`.

## Global Constraints

- Everything in the overview's "Global constraints (every plan)" and "Working conventions" applies. These are the lines that bite this plan, verbatim from the spec:
- **Package:** `io.github.iteatsthesalt.byways`.
- AGP 9.3.2 with built-in Kotlin (no `kotlin-android` plugin); Gradle 9.7.1; compileSdk 37, targetSdk 36, minSdk 24; `androidx.webkit:webkit:1.18.0` (fall back to 1.17.x if it does not resolve) and `androidx.activity`; JDK 21.
- No Gradle wrapper is committed; CI runs `gradle`.
- A **main WebView** for the Byways UI, served by `WebViewAssetLoader` at `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/assets/www/`.
- A **site view** WebView for opening finds full screen inside the app, with **Back to Byways**, **Next** and **Open in browser**. It has no bridge and no file access. `intent:` links open outside the app.
- The Lab, served by a second asset loader on its own origin, `https://lab.appassets.androidplatform.net/`. It gets no main bridge, only a small `BywaysLabNative` with `files.save`.
- WebView settings: JavaScript and DOM storage on; `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture=false`; third-party cookies on for the main WebView, so Archive embeds behave; file and content access off; mixed content never allowed; all WebView permission requests denied, because the mic goes through the native recogniser.
- Bridge: `WebViewCompat.addWebMessageListener(webView, "BywaysNative", setOf("https://appassets.androidplatform.net"))`. It accepts main-frame messages only. `addJavascriptInterface` is never used. It checks `WebViewFeature.WEB_MESSAGE_LISTENER` at startup.
- `nativeFetch`: Any `https` URL is allowed. `http` is allowed only to hosts you approved that are loopback, private-range IPs or `.local` names (for local models). It sends no cookies, has timeouts and caps responses at 10 MB. Keys are sent per request and never logged. All JSON API calls go through it. Images and embeds load normally. `network_security_config` allows cleartext, and the bridge code enforces the host rules.
- Manifest: `INTERNET` and `RECORD_AUDIO`; `<queries>` entries for `android.speech.RecognitionService` and `android.intent.action.TTS_SERVICE`; an `ACTION_SEND text/plain` intent filter.
- Voice runs only in the foreground and stops in `onPause`. Recogniser calls go through a main-thread handler. The first-run consent screen requests `RECORD_AUDIO`. Start: "No touch after first-run consent (Android 13+)".
- Android native voice: on-device recogniser when available, with `EXTRA_PREFER_OFFLINE`; on 13+ `EXTRA_SEGMENTED_SESSION` plus `EXTRA_AUDIO_SOURCE`; `EXTRA_LANGUAGE_MODEL=web_search` and `EXTRA_BIASING_STRINGS`. "Always on (13+). Tap to talk on 24–32."
- Read-aloud: "Android uses native `TextToSpeech` through the bridge, because WebView has no speech output." Network voices are marked "online".
- Wake lock: `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON` on Android. Headset: "Android uses a native media session."
- Lean-back runs in "the Android card view, or the Android site view when **Go straight to the site** is on (off by default)". "Lean-back never opens tabs by itself."
- Updates: "Settings → About checks `api.github.com/repos/iteatsthesalt/Game-Dev-Resources/releases/latest` and offers **Download update**."
- Signing: the release APK is signed when `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS` and `KEY_PASSWORD` exist.
- This machine has no Android SDK and blocks Google Maven downloads. Kotlin steps are verified by the `android` job in `.github/workflows/byways.yml`. Run Gradle locally only when `ANDROID_HOME` is set.

## Review Focus

1. **Hosts that only look local.** `http://192.168.1.5.nip.io`, `http://10.0.0.1@evil.com`, `http://2130706433`, `http://0x7f000001`, `http://[::ffff:8.8.8.8]` and a redirect from an approved LAN host to an unapproved one must all be refused, with no DNS lookup. Pinned by `deniesLookalikeHosts` (Task 3) and `blocksRedirectToUnapprovedHost` (Task 4).
2. **Frames and origins at the bridge.** An Archive embed iframe, a page on another origin, the Lab origin, or a sub-frame of the app must never reach `BywaysNative`. Pinned by `gateRejectsOtherOriginsAndSubframes` (Task 5).
3. **HTTP replies that are not plain 200s.** A 429 with `Retry-After`, a 204, a native network failure and an aborted request must reach `net/http.js` as a real `Response` or the same errors browser `fetch` gives, so the contract's retry logic still works. Pinned by `transport passes 429 and 204 through, maps failures and aborts` (Task 6).
4. **Messy shared text.** Text shared from chat apps carries extra words, trailing punctuation, several links, or no link. Byways share links must import, other links must become a find, and text with no link must show a message instead of crashing. Pinned by `extractSharedLink handles real share text` (Task 6) and `share-in with no link says so` (Task 13).
5. **Rotation and resizing.** Turning the phone or folding it must not reload the WebView and lose the current card or speech mid-sentence. Pinned by `activity keeps the WebView on rotation` (Task 2).

## Bridge protocol

Web → native request: `{"id":"<string>","ch":"<channel>","op":"<op>","args":{…}}`. Native reply: `{"id","ok":true,"result":…}` or `{"id","ok":false,"error":{"code","message"}}`. Native → web event: `{"ch","event","data"}`. Ids are decimal strings from a counter that starts at `"1"`.

| Channel | Ops (args → result) | Events (data) |
|---|---|---|
| `app` | `hello` {} → `{versionName, versionCode, sdk, micConsent}`; `checkUpdate` {} → `{available, latest, url}`; `openExternal` {url} → `true`; `openSite` {url, title} → `true`; `closeSite` {} → `true` | `shared` {text}; `siteNext` {} |
| `fetch` | `request` {url, method, headers, body} → `{status, statusText, headers, body, url}`; `abort` {fetchId} → `true`; `approve` {host} → `boolean` | — |
| `voice` | `probe` {allowCloud} → `VoiceStatus`; `install` {} → `boolean`; `start` {lang, phrases, allowCloud} → `true`; `stop` {} → `true` | `result` {text, final}; `state` {listening}; `error` {code} |
| `tts` | `speak` {text, voiceURI, rate, volume} → `true` at the end of the utterance; `cancel` {} → `true`; `voices` {} → `[{uri, name, lang, local}]` | — |
| `media` | `setActive` {on} → `true` | `next`, `previous`, `playPause` (data `{}`) |
| `share` | `send` {title, text, url} → `'shared'` | — |
| `files` | `save` {name, mime, base64} → `'saved'\|'cancelled'` | — |
| `back` | `result` {token, handled} → `true` | `request` {token} |
| `screen` | `keepOn` {on} → `true` | — |

Error codes: `bad-message`, `unknown-channel`, `unknown-op`, `too-large`, `internal`, the `FetchPolicy` and `NativeFetch` codes (Tasks 3–4), and the `VoiceErrorCode` names.
